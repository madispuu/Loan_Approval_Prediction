## Loan_Approval_Prediction
Rando Roosik, Madis Puu

# Motivation
The goal set in the project was to automate the evaluation of loan applications in order to predict precisely those who are not qualified to get a loan. This approach allows to reduce the need for manual evaluation and streamline the loan issuance process and do it faster.
The main motivation for it came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e10/overview) competition. The Kaggle page gave us the necessary datasets and foundation for our ideas and project.


# Guide
The main parts of the project in this repository are:
1) [D7_report.pdf](https://github.com/madispuu/Loan_Approval_Prediction/blob/main/D7_report.pdf) - Contains our Business understanding, Data understanding and Planning for our project.
2) [TEAM.ipynb](https://github.com/madispuu/Loan_Approval_Prediction/blob/main/TEAM.ipynb) - Jupyter file, that is our main work. It contains data analysis and training with both decision trees and random forests.
3) [test.csv](https://github.com/madispuu/Loan_Approval_Prediction/blob/main/test.csv) - Dataset from Kaggle, that we use in our work.
4) [train.csv](https://github.com/madispuu/Loan_Approval_Prediction/blob/main/train.csv) - Dataset from Kaggle, that we use in our work.

# Replicate
To replicate the same analysis you just have to clone the repository and then open TEAM.ipynb with Jupyter Notebook. Then up top open "Kernel" and choose "Restart Kernel and run all cells". Make sure you have Kaggle_submission.png and both test.csv and train.csv in the same folder with the TEAM.ipynb, otherwise the analysis will fail, because the code uses those files to do work.
